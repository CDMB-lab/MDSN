The repository is organised as follows:
MutualInformation.m : This function is used to calculate the MI value of SNP interaction.
mutualInfoTool.m : This function transfer the function "MutualInformation.m" to get the MI values of different order SNP combinations.
multiSURF.m ï¼š This function is used to calculate the Score array "score".
MDSN.py : This is the main function of MDSN, and the final recognition result (K-order SNP combination related to diseases) is obtained by inputting SNP data.
Input : SNP data, please refer to the data file in the provided simulation data folder for specific data format. Users can run MDSN with different data by modifying the content in lines 15 and 370 of "MDSN.py".
Output : K-order SNP combination related to diseases and epistatic network recognized by MDSN.
