The repository is organised as follows:<br>
* `MutualInformation.m` : This function is used to calculate the MI value of SNP interaction.
* `mutualInfoTool.m` : This function transfer the function "MutualInformation.m" to get the MI values of different order SNP combinations.
* `multiSURF.m` ï¼š This function is used to calculate the Score array "score".
* `MDSN.py` : This is the main function of MDSN, and the final recognition result (K-order SNP combination related to diseases) is obtained by inputting SNP data.
